# a)	Define a target metric to measure user engagement. How would you define an engaged vs. unengaged user? 
# 
# b)	Using your logic from above, build a model (heuristic/statistical/ML) 
#     to classify engaged and unengaged users. 
#     Note that features which are directly correlated with your target metric could lead to overfitting.
# 
# c)	Letâ€™s assume an unengaged user is a churned user. 
#     Now suppose we use your model to identify unengaged users 
#     and implement some business actions try to convert them to engaged users 
#     (commonly known as reducing churn). 
#     How would you set up a test/experiment to check whether we are actually reducing churn?
# 
# d)	In the past, one business action we took to reduce churn was to re-engage inactive users. 
#     Our engagement team designed a marketing campaign, 
#     REENGAGEMENT_ACTIVE_FUNDS to remind inactive users about funds on their Revolut account. 
#     Define a metric to measure the effectiveness of the campaign. 
#     Under this metric, was the campaign effective?
